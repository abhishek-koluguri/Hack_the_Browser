# Hack_the_Browser

Project Purpose:

The intent of this project is to act as a POC for the possibility of optimizing the browser usage of web apps for delivering the content to the client.

Problem Statement: How to reduce to our Web-Client Customers’ time spent waiting for their content to be presented on their screen?

Potential Solution: Use Browser’s capability of caching and ETags to serve content faster.

Benefits:

Better web app performance:

Faster response time. Lesser load on our servers helping us save some infrastructure costs (reducing number of instances needed).

HIPAA compliant: because cache is on the user’s machine under his/her profile only.

Enhancements:

Using a better algorithm for encryption and decryption of customer’s files. Other in-memory caching techniques can also be used for frequently used files in certain time period.
